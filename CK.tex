We use capital letters for the momenta and coordinates, since we will think of those as random variables, where we can translate Hamilton's deterministic equations to the Kolmogorov Chapman equations leading to a deterministic equation of motion for the joint distribution, a master equation, for example see page 10 of Van Kampen\cite{vankampen}.
