In the language of HMMs, the value of a configuration vector reveals the hidden state of the sequence. Here there are 5 states, where the 'silent' state indicates a transcription factor is bound to an upstream position of the sequence, causing the loci to be covered by an internal position of the planted factor. \relax }}{143}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.3}{\ignorespaces  Changing the spacing between motifs in modules change the span of cells that are expressed. In this Figure the spacing between two sites was adjusted by Natural Selection in orthologs of the \textit  {rhomboid} gene's CRM. When the ortholog CRMs were transgenically inserted into \textit  {mel} species the width of the expression pattern changes relative to the endogenous pattern width, suggesting that coopertivity between the sites is a function of the distance between sites that can be used by evolution to 'fine tune' the epression patterns in development. When each sequence or module is expressed in its respective specie (lineage), then the relative widths (w/L where L is the lengths of the major axis of the specie's embryo, w is the width of the tissue in nanometers that express the gene) of the tissues are the same. Different specie's embryos have different sizes hence there is a scaling law - how a characteristic (such as gene expression) changes with body size.
